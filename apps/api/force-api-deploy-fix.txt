ðŸš¨ URGENT API FIX - Railway serving frontend instead of API

ISSUE: https://conferenciaapi-production.up.railway.app was serving the frontend HTML instead of API JSON responses

FIXED:
- Corrected apps/api/railway.json configuration
- Changed buildCommand from frontend to API build
- Changed startCommand from frontend preview to API start

This file forces Railway to redeploy the API with correct configuration.
